00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,500
In 1784, William Hollins starts a business in Pleasley, Derbyshire.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
The business creates a fabric called Viyella.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,500
Viyella is a signature Irish fabric loved by people around the world.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Viyella is registered as a trademark in 1894,

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,000
and in 1907, the trademark is registered in the US of A.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,250
Woohoo!

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,750
But in the sixties,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
many poor young girls who are kept in places called Magdalene asylums are made to work for Viyella.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,500
Magdalene asylums were places where girls could be put

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,000
when they had a baby and the baby's father ran away.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,250
Some of the girls got pregnant because they were raped.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,000
Then they were put in a Magdalene asylum,

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
so the church could put their life back in order.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,200
While they were staying in the Magdalene asylums,

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
the girls had a lot of work to do.

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,900
They were washing clothes in the laundries,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,500
and they were making Viyella fabric too.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,500
The church got money for the Viyella fabric,

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,750
but the church did not pay the girls any money for making the fabric.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Both the church and the Viyella business made good money.

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,750
The poor little penitents kept working and working,

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,750
and many of them stayed in the asylums for a long, long time.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,500
In 2010, the Irish Human Rights Commission told the government that the penitents,

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,750
who are now old,

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,000
should finally get some money

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,000
for all the work that they did when they were young girls.

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,000
But the government did not do anything.

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,750
Anyhoo.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In 2024, Morrison McConnell celebrate 240 years of Viyella.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Viyella is a Morrison McConnell brand,

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,800
and Morrison McConnell will continue to give people

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,250
the Viyella fabric that they love.
