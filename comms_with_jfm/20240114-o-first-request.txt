Good day

I am Andouille Santoso, a digital media artist located in Naarm/Melbourne, Australia. In preparation of Morrison McConnell's 240 year celebration of the Viyella brand, which will take place at the 4―6 February ‘INDX Man’ trade show in Birmingham, I have prepared a campaign kit. By reading your submission to the UN, it has come to my attention that penitent labour was used to produce Viyella fabric in the 1960s. Morrison McConnell, who own the Viyella brand, are not acknowledging that on their internet presence. I have contacted Morrison McConnell and asked them if they are ready to publicly acknowledge this fact. I have not received an answer.

Please use the link below as an entrance to the campaign kit. A PDF leaflet and a YouTube video can be found linked to in the top section of the page.

You are welcome to use the campaign kit to attract attention to this cause. Regardless of whether or not you choose to do this, I will go ahead and publish all of this coinciding with Morrison McConnell's trade show presentation.

Kind regards
Andouille Santoso
