Good day

I am Brent Callaway, an independent researcher. The group ‘Justice for Magdalenes Research’ have made a submission to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review. In ‘Appendix II: Selected witness statements’ of that document, ‘Testimony A’, subsection ‘Abuse and neglect and forced labour in the Magdalene Laundry’, the person giving testimony states:

‘I heard one of the girls saying – bearing in mind this is 1963 to 1969, all those years ago – about 25 pounds for a dress in them days, by them days‘ money. They were making big money. It was Viyella.’

On your website, I have not come across any mention of the use of penitents for services to Viyella between 1963 and 1969. Are Morrison McConnell ready to publicly acknowledge that penitent labour was used in creating Viyella products during said period?

Sincerely
Brent Callaway
