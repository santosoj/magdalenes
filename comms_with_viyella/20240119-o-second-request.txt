Good day

On the 12th, I have sent you a request regarding Morrison McConnell's position on acknowledging the use of penitent labour in producing Viyella fabric in the 1960s. Simply not answering does not make this matter go away. I would therefore, for a second time, like to ask you, are Morrison McConnell ready to publicly acknowledge the fact that penitent labour was used in producing Viyella fabric in the 1960s?

Sincerely
Brent Callaway
